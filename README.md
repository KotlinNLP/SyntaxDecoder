# TransitionSystems

TransitionSystems is a generalized transition-based parsing framework designed to simplify the development of 
statistical transition-based dependency parsers.

TransitionSystems is part of [KotlinNLP](http://kotlinnlp.com/ "KotlinNLP").


## Introduction

TransitionSystems provides a unified framework to describe *states* as well as a set of *transitions* that lead the 
system from one state to the next.
It allows to compare various transition-based algorithms from both a theoretical and empirical perspective.

The package includes well-known transition systems (e.g. ArcStandard, ArcHybrid, EasyFirst) but also previously 
unstudied systems. Different types of oracle (*static*, *non-deterministic*, *dynamic*) are implemented for each of 
them.
