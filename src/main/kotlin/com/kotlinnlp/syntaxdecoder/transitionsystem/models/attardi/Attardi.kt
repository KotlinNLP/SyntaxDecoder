/**
 * The Attardi Transition System (Attardi, 2006).
 *
 * Attardi (2006) instead introduced transitions that add dependency arcs between the roots of non-adjacent subtrees
 * (nonadjacent arc transitions) â€“  maintaining linear time complexity but with incomplete coverage of
 * non-projective structures.
 *
 * Notice that the implemented transitions rules are slightly different from those reported in Attardi (2006).
 * The fundamental difference is that each reduction rule puts back into the input queue the token that has been
 * connected as head. This allows for such token to be further involved in new transitions.
